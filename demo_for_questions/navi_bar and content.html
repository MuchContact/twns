			Jennifer Call, the Rescue Committee's family education coordinator, said her groups sometimes start off shy but that the interactive experience gets them talking. "Field trips like this really bring the class together," she said.

Before visiting Victoria's first-floor apartment along a dim, dilapidated hallway, the group gathered in a visitor's center classroom. There a museum worker gave a short history on Victoria's family and her job sewing aprons and introduced them to unfamiliar vocabulary words like "tenement" and "homesick" before inviting them to share their own stories. Later they reconvened in the classroom for further discussion on topics that touched on religious freedom and education.

The classes are adjusted according to the level of English proficiency but always focus on the museum's mission of connecting immigrants of today with immigrants of the past. They're popular with dozens of organizations and language schools that offer English as a second language. The adult program recently expanded to include high school and middle school students. The museum offers 150 workshops and averages about 1,700 participants a year.

Victoria's story is one of six interactive experiences at the museum, each providing an opportunity to discuss social and civic issues of the day that still resonate today.

They include the 1935 apartment of Rosaria and Adolpho Baldizzi who came to the U.S. during the height of the first immigration restrictions. Discussions sometimes focus on what it means to be "American." Or visitors can choose to go to the 1897 apartment of the Levine family who ran a small garment factory in their home. They later talk about the conditions in factories and the larger issue of acceptable working conditions.

Raul Betancourt, 39, like others attending the workshop, thought life for immigrants was easier today. He quickly found an apartment through the Internet after coming from Venezuela two months ago.

"Technology makes a big difference," he said.
